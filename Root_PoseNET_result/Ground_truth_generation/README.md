## ground_plane_with_skeletons.py
Run ground_plane_with_skeletons.py with data output_pose_GP010170. It can indicate both ground plane and moving skeletons in camera coordiante.

## ground_truth_generation.py
Run ground_truth_generation.py with data output_pose_GP010170. This script can move skeletons back on the true ground plane in camera coordiante and export the adjusted 3d skeletons named Ground_truth_GP010170.

## plot_adjusted_skeletons.py
After run ground_truth_generation.py, run plot_adjusted_skeletons.py with data Ground_truth_GP010170. It can indicate both ground plane and adjusted moving skeletons in camera coordiante.
